# `rref.py`: a simple RREF working generator.

## Why?

- I was bored in class.
- Most websites online just tell you the final answer without any working; I thought, why not also print some intermediate working?

## How do I run this?

- Have Python 3 installed.
- Run `rref.py` with `python rref.py` (or `python3 rref.py` if that doesn't work)
- Follow program instructions. Program exits on illegal input (I'm lazy to loop input) so rerun the program if it suddenly exits.
- Take the output (below `==LATEX OUTPUT==`) and paste into a basic LaTeX template (you can run LaTeX online with [Overleaf](overleaf.com))
- Compile.

### LaTeX template:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{amsmath}

\begin{document}
% PASTE CODE HERE
\end{document}
```
